Instruction to recreate all the data from Figure 1:

1. Get your nuclei and make the 3D model for the chromosomes using the python script for imagej: "trace_and_export_rois.py"
    This create the sbs_rois.zip files that can be used for making the 3d models and straightening the chromosomes
2. Straighten the chromosomes by running the imagej script: "straighten_traced_chromosomes.ijm"
    This creates the _str.tif files that most of other scripts actually use as a basis.
    The _str files can also be zero clamped if they have negative values form the cromagnon reconstruction. 
3. Get the crossover coordinates by running the imagej script: "get_multiple_co_coords.ijm"
    This creates the _str_co_coords.csv files with the crossover positions.
4. Split the megasomes into the co1 and co2 files using the "c018_split_megasomes.ijm"
    This will create two files from the _str.tif for the co1 and co2 simulating "wild type" chromosomes
    from the megasome image.
5. Make the sum projections using the script: "c018_megasomes_make_sum_projection.ijm"
    This makes the megasomes and the split megasomes sum projections. 
6. Obtain the megasome observed categories by running the script: "c018_categorize_chromosomes.ijm"
    This opens each sum projected image and the user is able to categorize the chromosomes 
    to get the observed category that is lated used for the plotting and contrasted to the 
    predicted category. 
7. Make the plot using the script "c018_megasome_flip_triangle_plot_single_region.py"
    This will make the triangle plot with all the megasomes.
8. Normalize the megasome channels for the image combination using the script: "c018_normalize_sum_projections.ijm"
    The user will make thresholds for the restriction site of the proteins in the channels and the 
    entire channel will be normalized to the average intensity of the threshold to have comparable image values
    for the combination of the megasomes.
9. Make the combined image by running the script: "c018_combine_roi_normalized_split_megasomes_images.py"
    This will create the combined image with the normalized split megasomes. 
10. Measure the split megasome regions by running the script: "c018_measure_split_megasomes_arms.ijm"
    This will measure the split megasome arms, create the rois needed and save the results as a csv file. 
11. Make the plot short arm differences by running the script: "c018_plot_short_long_arm_dirrecence.py"
    This will create the plot comparing the short and long arm differences.
