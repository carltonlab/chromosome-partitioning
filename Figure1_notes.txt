Instruction to recreate all the data from Figure 1:

1. Get your nuclei and make the 3D model for the chromosomes using the python script for imagej: trace_and_export_rois.py
    This create the sbs_rois.zip files that can be used for making the 3d models and straightening the chromosomes
2. Straighten the chromosomes by running the imagej script: straighten_traced_chromosomes.ijm
    This creates the _str.tif files that most of other scripts actually use as a basis. 
3. Get the crossover coordinates by running the imagej script: c012_get_straightened_chromosomes_co_position.ijm
    This creates the _str_roi.zip files with the crossover positions, the short arm and long arm rois and could also flip the images so that the short arm is on the left. 
    It also creates sum projections of the iamges.
4. Normalize the sum projected images created in step 3 by running the python script: c012_normalize_straightened_chromosomes_by_channel.py
    This creates the _normalized_sum_proj.tif images used in other scripts. 
5. Align the chromosomes by running the python script: c012_align_chromosomes_by_crossover_position.py
    This will get the sorted images used in figure 1.
6. Get the short and long arm average intensity measurements by running the python script: c012_get_arm_differences.py
    This will get the csv files with the short and long arm average intensities for all of the channels in the images. 
7. To get the plots, you need to run the python script: c012_plot_short_and_long_arm_average_intensities.py
    This creates the plots based on the csv files obtained in step 6.
